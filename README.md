# Meteo_Station
We developed a weather monitoring station using an STM32 microcontroller to measure temperature, humidity, and wind speed. All parameters were calibrated and displayed with minimum, maximum, and current values. We implemented a color-coded LED LCD system that used light animations to indicate the real-time range of each measurement. For the wind sensor, we 3D-printed custom-designed blades and collaborated with a lathe operator to manufacture a custom aluminum shaft, ensuring mechanical stability and precise rotation. The project combined embedded systems programming, sensor integration, and custom hardwareÂ prototyping.
